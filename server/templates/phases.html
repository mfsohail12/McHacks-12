                <b>Registered:</b> The patient or their family provide basic information and a medical record (electronic or on paper) is generated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Triaged:</b> A nurse evaluates the patient's condition and assigns a triage level (1-5). This determines how urgently they need care relative to other patients.
            </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Please note that the length of waiting will vary dependent on your triage level.

            <li>
                <b>Investigation Pending:</b> Doctors assess the patient and may order tests (blood work, imaging, etc.). If ordered, tests are performed and there is more waiting for test results to come back.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Treated:</b> Once tests results are available the doctor reviews them and generates a treatment plan, and the patient is treated
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Admitted:</b> If the patients require monitoring and further care, they may be admitted to the hospital
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Discharged:</b> Once the patient is treated, they are discharged from the hospital.
